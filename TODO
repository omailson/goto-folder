List all bookmarks

List all aliases
$ GOTOFOLDER/goto-completion.py

Resolve alias
$ goto <alias>

TODO:
* goto-completion.py should return the suggestions instead of making us use compgen -W for that matter
  * This or change the name of goto-completion.py to a more appropriate one (if we're not dealing with completion with that python code)
* Group bookmakrs when listing them all
  * One idea is to group by where .goto files are located
  * Another is to group by folders where bookmarks area pointing to (eg: a/b/c and a/b/x are grouped together because they have a/b in common)
. Remove next_resolver param from BaseResolver (allow method overrides only)
